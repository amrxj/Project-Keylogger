README for Keylogger Script
Description
This script is a basic keylogger written in Python. It records all keypresses on the keyboard to a file named definitelynotalog.txt. The script stops recording when the Esc key is pressed.

Features
Keypress Recording: Logs every keypress event to a file.
Live Monitoring: Continuously monitors keypresses until stopped.
Stop Condition: The script automatically terminates when the Esc key is pressed.
Requirements
Python 3.x
The keyboard library (install with pip install keyboard)
How It Works
Open File for Logging: The script creates (or overwrites if it already exists) a file named definitelynotalog.txt to store the logged keypresses.
Hooking into Keyboard Events: The script uses keyboard.hook() to monitor all keyboard events.
Logging Key Events: When a key is pressed, the script writes the key name to the log file immediately.
Stop Mechanism: The script halts when the Esc key is pressed and closes the log file.
Usage Instructions
Install the keyboard library if not already installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install keyboard
Save the script to a file (e.g., keylogger.py).
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
Press keys on your keyboard to log them. The key names will be recorded in definitelynotalog.txt.
To stop the script, press the Esc key. The log file will be closed.
Notes
Ethical Use Only: This script should only be used with the explicit consent of all involved parties. Unauthorized use for recording keyboard inputs is illegal and unethical.
No Background Execution: This script runs in the foreground and stops when the terminal is closed.
